\opening{Dear Dr. Sadras:}

Thank you for providing reviewer comments for our manuscript ``Rice
yield improvements through plant breeding are offset by inherent yield
declines over time''. All reviewers agreed that our work was suitable
for publication in Field Crops Research, and provided minor comments
to improve the manuscript. We have addressed all of these comments, including:

\begin{itemize}
\item{Slightly modified the model structure as suggested by the
  statistical reviewer, which resulted in a stronger model but
  effectively identical results.}
\item{Directly addressed concerns about the tone of the paper by
  changing the terminology used throughout the paper, and adding
  discussion to further clarify uncertainties about the exact causes
  of the observed yield declines.}
\item{Added commentary expanding and clarifying how our work relates
  to previous work in rice systems (e.g., MacKenzie et al., 2014)}
\item{Give what appeared to be a lack of clarity by the reviewers, We
  have restructured the discussion to aid flow and readability.}
\end{itemize}

Our manuscript is much improved following these changes. We hope you
find it suitable for publication in Field Crops Research.

\closing{Sincerely,}
\encl{Enclosures.}
